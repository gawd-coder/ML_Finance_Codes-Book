<p>For instructions on how to set up the Python environment and run the notebooks please refer to <a href="../SETUP.html">SETUP.html</a> in the <em>ML_Finance_Codes</em> directory.</p>
<p>This chapter contains the following notebooks:</p>
<h3 id="ml_in_finance-rnns-bitcoin.ipynb">ML_in_Finance-RNNs-Bitcoin.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>This notebook shows an example of a recurrent neural network (RNN) for time series prediction. Please refer to Chapter 8, Sections 2-4 in the textbook</li>
<li>To select an appropriate model architecture, the univariate time series <code>coinbase.csv</code> is analysed for stationarity and its partial auto-correlation function is estimated</li>
<li>The time series is transformed into a set of input sequences and corresponding outputs for use with the RNN, and split into training and testing sets</li>
<li>RNN, alphaRNN, alphatRNN, LSTM &amp; GRU models are trained on the time series</li>
<li>An example of a time series cross-validation procedure is provided
<ul>
<li>This is disabled by default; the cross-validation process involves training the model many times, and can take many hours to complete.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="ml_in_finance-1d-cnns.ipynb">ML_in_Finance-1D-CNNs.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>This notebook shows the process of creating a 1D convolutional neural network with Keras. Please refer to Chapter 8, Section 5 of the textbook</li>
<li>An example timeseries is created and formatted for the training of the model</li>
<li>Its ability to predict beyond the training data is demonstrated by comparing its predictions to the true values</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ml_in_finance-2d-cnns.ipynb">ML_in_Finance-2D-CNNs.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>This notebook shows the process of creating a 2D convolutional neural network. Please refer to Chapter 8, Section 5 of the textbook</li>
<li>The MNIST dataset is loaded and transformed for input into the model, and split into a training and testing set</li>
<li>The modelâ€™s out-of-sample classification performance is evaluated on the test set</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ml_in_finance-autoencoders.ipynb">ML_in_Finance-Autoencoders.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>This notebook compares linear dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis against that achieved in an autoencoder neural network. Please refer to Chapter 8, Section 6 in the textbook</li>
<li>A review of PCA is provided</li>
<li>An autoencoding neural network is created and trained on the <code>yield_curves.csv</code> data set</li>
<li>The results of using the principal components and the weights learned by the autoencoder to transform the dataset are compared</li>
