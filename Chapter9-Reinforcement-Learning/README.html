<p>This chapter contains the following notebooks:</p>
<h3 id="ml_in_finance_fcw.ipynb">ML_in_Finance_FCW.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>This notebook shows the application of reinforcement learning to the financial cliff walking problem. The problem is described in Example 9.4 in the textbook.</li>
<li>A discretised, time-dependent action value function is</li>
<li>The convergence of the algorithms is compared by plotting the average reward gained against number of training episodes</li>
<li>The actions learned for each state by the two algorithms are inspected</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ml_in_finance_market_impact.ipynb">ML_in_Finance_Market_Impact.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>This notebook shows the application of SARSA and Q-learning to the optimal stock execution problem described in Example 9.5 in the textbook.</li>
<li>The convergence of the algorithms is compared by plotting the average reward gained against number of training episodes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ml_in_finance_marketmaking.ipynb">ML_in_Finance_MarketMaking.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>This notebook shows the application of reinforcement learning to the problem of high-frequency market making. The problem is described in Example 9.6 in the textbook.</li>
<li>SARSA and Q-learning are applied to learn time-independent optimal policies based on historical limit order book data.</li>
<li>The convergence of the algorithms is compared by plotting the reward gained after each training episode</li>
<li>An animation demonstrating the behaviour of the learned policies is shown</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ml_in_finance_lspi_markowitz.ipynb">ML_in_Finance_LSPI_Markowitz.ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reinforcement learning is applied to the problem of optimal allocation</li>
<li>The least squares policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm is applied to a Monte Carlo simulation of a stockâ€™s price movements, constructing a basis over the state-action space using B-spline basis functions at each time period.</li>
<li>The optimal Q-function is approximated with a dynamic programming approach, and this is shown to approach the exact solution</li>
