# Machine Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice

## Chapter 2: Probabilistic Modeling

This chapter contains the following notebooks.

For instructions on how to set up the Python environment and run the notebooks please refer to [SETUP.html](../SETUP.html) in the *ML_Finance_Codes* directory.

### ML_in_Finance_Bayesian_vs_Frequentist_Estimation.ipynb
 * This notebook illustrates the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian estimation under Bernoulli trials. Please refer to Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 2 
 * The effect of prior selection in Bayesian estimation is demonstrated by comparing the results from an informative and an uninformative prior pdf
 
### ML_in_Finance-Bias-Variance-Tradeoff.ipynb
 * This notebook illustrates the "bias-variance tradeoff" or "bias-variance dilemma". Please refer to Sections 4 and 5 of Chapter 2
 * A toy dataset, split into training and validation sets, is created by adding Gaussian noise to a trigonometric function
 * Polynomial models of increasing complexity are fit to the training data, demonstrating the tradeoff between in- and out-of-sample performance
